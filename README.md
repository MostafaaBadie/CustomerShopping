The dataset includes essential information such as invoice numbers, customer IDs, age, gender, payment methods, product categories, quantity, price, order dates, and shopping mall locations.

In this dataset, I intend to explore the following in this dataset via Visualization:
1-What gender has the most purchased and spending
2-Distribution of data based on age and spending
3- Payment method with the highest contribution to transactions
4-Average total bill for each category
5-The most sales in the shopping malls
6-Categories with the most sales
7-Performance of all malls across years.
8-Total Sales across years.
